// pch.h: This is the precompiled header file.
// The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves the generation performance of future generations.
// This will also affect IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code browsing features.
// However, if any of the files listed here are updated between generations, they will all be recompiled.
// Do not add files to be updated frequently here, as this will invalidate the performance advantage.
